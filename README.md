# CruX-Project

A web-based application designed to continuously record motor-based EEG signals, with the output being a small avatar that moves either left or right depending on the signal.

Users' information is stored in firebase, and is fetched as the need arises. Threading is used to continuously update the webpage. The layout is a combination of HTML/CSS, Flask, and Bootstrap.
